% urls.sty -- URL Simplifier.
%
% This style file (by Michael Frank <mpf@ai.mit.edu>) is intended to make
% it easier to include literal URLs and other similar strings in TeX/LaTeX
% files.
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------

% \rh -- Roman discretionary Hyphen.
% Use this inside \tt style literal strings so that the
% discretionary line-break hyphen will be in roman
% font, making it clear it's not part of the literal.
\def\rh{{\rm \discretionary{-}{}{}}}

%
% \db -- Discretionary Break.
%
% Use this wherever you want an extra opportunity for line
% breaking, whether in a URL or some other long literal
% string.  Warning: doesn't hyphenate the breaks!  For
% that, use \-.
%
\def\db{\discretionary{}{}{}}

% 
% I don't know why something like the following macro wasn't built
% into TeX from the beginning.  Use this for standalone tildes, e.g.,
% in URLs or UNIX filenames.
% 
\def\tild{\char126}

% \us -- UnderScore
% Typewriter-font underscore (use \_ for a text font underscore).
%
\def\us{{\tt\char95}}

% 
% \url -- Universal Resource Locator
%
% The following hack (original version by Carl Witty) defines a \url macro,
% so that if you write a long URL like
%
%   {\url http://foo.bar.baz.bot/~bim/bom/bam/buzz_biff.html}
%
% TeX will print the URL in typewriter font, and will know that it is
% allowed to break a line after any colon (:), slash (/), dot (.), hyphen
% (-), underscore (_), or at-sign (@) in the URL.  Also, tildes and
% underscores will be printed properly.  Any line-breaks following a dot
% (.)  will use a roman-style discretionary hyphen, to avoid the appearance
% of an end-of-sentence.  Also you can use \- to indicate other
% line-breaking opportunities (such as in the middle of words) where a
% roman-style discretionary hyphen should be used.
% 
% Without this macro, TeX will break lines containing URLs really poorly,
% any tildes will be interpreted as non-breaking spaces, and any
% underscores will appear in roman font.
% 
% Remember to use \url only within braces, because otherwise your whole
% document will be interpreted as a URL.  I couldn't figure out how to get
% it to work properly in the form \url{...}.
%
% Bug: this macro doesn't seem to allow line breaks when it's used within
% footnotes; I don't know why.
