< A brief summary of the socio-historical setting in which Sri Lanka Malay developed is helpful to give a background to the analysis presented in this paper. Most of what we know of the history of the Sri Lanka Malay community comes from the work of the historian (and community member) B.A. Hussainmiya. The following summary is based largely on Hussainmiya's work, and in particular \citet{Hussainmiya1987}. The Dutch colonial administration began bringing Indonesians to Sri Lanka in 1656, following the expulsion of the Portuguese. These immigrants consisted of political exiles, criminal deportees, soldiers and slaves. Political exiles consisted chiefly of Javanese aristocrats, but also included members of the elite from Sumatra, Maluku (the Moluccas), Makassar, and Timor. Soldiers made up a much larger contingent of immigrants, and came from Ambon, Banda, Bali, Java, Madura and from the Buginese and Malay areas \citep[24]{Adelaar1991}. A form of Vehicular Malay became the lingua franca of the community, and led to the community identifying itself as `Malay' despite its diverse origins. This identity was reinforced by later waves of immigration under the British administration beginning in 1796, which were recruited mainly from the Malay Peninsula.

< Apart from the shared features of EITM described in \citet{Paauw2008}, there has been little information available on the three major dialect regions of Malay. Happily, that situation is improving. For the past 17 years, David Gil has been working on the Malay/Indonesian Dialect Mapping Project, cataloguing 300 linguistic features (lexical, phonological, and grammatical) in locations throughout the Malay world. He has given names to the three varieties, and his terms will be used here for these varieties. The ``Group I'' languages are referred to as ``Malaka'', after the trading entrep\^ot in the region where those language varieties are spoken, which had significant historical importance. The ``Group II'' languages are ``Java'', representing the cultural and political center of those language varieties, while the varieties descended from EITM are known as ``Maluku'', for the spice islands which were the center of the Eastern Indonesia trade.

< David Gil's Malay/Indonesian Dialect Mapping Project referred to earlier includes a number of lexical items which can be associated with the patterns of the three dialects of Malay. Although \citet{Gil2010} does not address many of these in relation to Sri Lanka Malay, presumably because most items show a convergence with two varieties while Gil was concerned with items converging with a single variety, it is worthwhile to examine these lexical items and how SLM fits into the picture. This is particularly illuminating because these are lexical items selected specifically because they are associated with particular varieties and thus can provide information about the origins of SLM. The chart below presents these items.

< All three English words listed are suspect, as English influence on Malay did not begin until after the SLM community was established, and these words (\textit{bangkrot} `bankrupt', \textit{bistek} `steak', and \textit{pensil} `pencil') were probably borrowed separately into SLM and Malay proper, and owe their common forms to coincidence.
< 
< One word, however, is very surprising, and that is the Dutch loan \textit{baiskop} `cinema' (\textit{bioskop} in Indonesian varieties of Malay, from Dutch \textit{bioskoop}). Its entry into SLM would seem to postdate by over a century any Dutch influence on the language.
