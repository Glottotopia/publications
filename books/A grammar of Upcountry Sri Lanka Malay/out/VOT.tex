 \caption{[g] in the absolute onset of \phontrs{gu:\umb u}{Negombo (town)} is fully voiced and has a negative VOT of about 0.068s (above). This can be seen from the pitch contour, which is present during the whole articulation of g. Since pitch can only be measured on voiced parts, the pitch contour can be used to identify voicing. The image below shows that the pitch contour is absent for  [\dentt] and [p], but voicing sets in as soon as closure of the mouth is released and the vocalic part begins, i.e. we  have a voice onset time of close to zero in the onsets [\dentt u-, pa-, pa-].}

 \caption{It is rare to find aspirated consonants in SLM, indentified by long VOTs, like the [k] in \phontrs{ka\postalvn\postalvd i}{Kandy (town)} the example above, which has a VOT of 0.049s. One can see from the black shading that the closure is already released, but the voicing has not started yet (indicated by the pitch line).
It is much more common to have VOTs under 0.020s, as is the case with all the stops in the example below}
