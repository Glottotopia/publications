``The Sri Lankan Malay are a small community of 47000 (Ministry of Plan Implementation 1988:13), constituting just 0,32\% of the Sri Lankan population. In English they call themselves Sri Lanka Malays [\dots]. They refer to themselves as o:ra\Ng{ }Ja:wa or o:ra\Ng{ }Mala:yu [\dots]. By the Sinhalese, they are called \em Ja minissu\em, by the Tamils \em Java Manusar\em, and by the Moors, \em Malai Karar\em, all three meaning `Malay person' ''\citet[1]{Bichsel}.
``The Sri Lankan Malays are Sunni Muslims of the Shafi sect. Since their arrival in Sir Lanka, they have been in close contact with the Moors, who profess the same religion.''\citet[1]{Bichsel}.
``A city people, 78\% of the Malays live in urban areas \citet[75]{Marga1988}'' Their communities are situated all over the island.'' \citet[2]{Bichsel}. According to Bichsel-Stettner, the Malay population concentrates in the population centers given in table \ref{tab:MalayPopCtr}.

``A comparison of the data from 1949 with that of 1981 shows that the communities in Colombo, Gampaha, and Hamabantota have been expanding very rapidly, indicating the migration of Malays to these areas.''\citet[2]{Bichsel}
``In Colombo, the main Malay neighborhood since British times has been Slave Island, which is situated in the center of the city''\citet[2]{Bichsel}
The Gampaha community formed only after WW I, when rising land proces drove Malays from Colombo to Gampaha.\citet[cf.][2]{Bichsel}
\section{General History}
~ 
\subsection{Precolonial history}
``During the Dambadeniya period (1220--1293 A.D.)Javanese Forces headed by Chandrabhaanu who professed to be a Buddhist, had made an attempt to invade Sri Lanka. Thi sattemot was successfully repulsed by the Sinhalas. [...] The beginnings of Malay/Javanese linguistic influence on the Sinhala language could therefore be traced from about the beginning of the Polonnaruva period (1098--1234 A.D.)''\citep[97]{Sannagala1976}

``Sri Lanka lies along the trade routes from the Malay Archipelago to the Middle East ans East Africa. En route, seafarers passed Sri Lanka and South India. Although, from about the 2^{nd} century, people from the Malay Archipelago began to settle in Madagascar, no archeological evidence of such an early South East Asian presence in Sri Lanka has been found. %(DeSilva)
But a comparison of iconographical finds in Western Java has led Pierre Dupont [\dots]%(1959)
to postulate contact between Java and Sri Lanka in the 5^{th} or 6^{th} century, possibly even in the 2^{nd} or 3^{rd} century. Further evidence of early cultural relations between Java nd Sri Lanka is provided by an 8^{th} century inscription found in central Java that refers to Sinhalese ascetics and the Abhayagiri Vih\A ra, a famous monastery at Anur\A dhapura% De Casparis
''\citep[5]{Bichsel}
``The C\uu lavamsa %binduva??
gives the earliest written reference of the arrival of people from the Malay Archipelago in Sri Lanka. Chandrabh\A nu of T\A mbralinga, the Buddhist king of a Malay Kingdom, attacked the Sinhalese kingdom twice during the 13^{th} century. He succeeded in gaining a foothold in the north of Sri Lanka and became the ruler of the Jaffna Kingdom. However, Chandrabh\A nus dynasty was short-lived, with the Pandyans of South India installing a Pandyan ruler as the successor to his son.'' %desilva67
\citep[6]{Bichsel}

``There is no evidence that the root sof the present day Malay community go back to such early contacts''\citep[6]{Bichsel}
%Hussainmiya84 46f
\subsection{History during Portuguese rule}
\citet[6f.]{Bichsel} affirms that there is no historical evidence of a sizeable Malay community in Sri Lanka and doubts that the Portuguese, who persecuted Muslims, would have tolerated the spread of Malays in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, all present day Malays affirm that their ancestors arrived no earlier that the Dutch period.
\subsection{History during Dutch rule}
The Dutch evicted the Portuguese from Sri Lanka in 1640. During that time, they were already controling large parts of the Malay Archipelago and thus commanded companies of Malay soldiers \citep[cf.][7]{Bichsel}. 
\subsubsection{Provenance of the Malays}
``The ancestors of the Sri Lanka Malays  came to Sri Lanka between 1656 and 1850 from the Dutch and the English possessions in the Malay Archipelago''\citet[1]{Bichsel}. Four different types of immigrants came to Sri Lanka, exiles, convicts, slaves and soldiers
\paragraph{Exiles}
``Many were political deportees exiled from the territories of the United East India Company for resisting Dutch domination.''\citet[1]{Bichsel}.
``Member of the Indonesian nobility unwilling to submit to Dutch rule were exiled to Sri Lanka and South Africa [\dots] The earliest exiles came from the Moluccas and the Lesser Sunda Islands, while Dutch douments refer to many exiles from Java as a result of the Javanese wars of succession in the late 17{th} century as well as aristocrats from Bacan, Tidore, Timor, Madura and Sumatra. By the late 18^{th} century, the political exiles numbered about 200, approximately 10\% of the Malay population in Sri Lanka at the time.\citep[7]{Bichsel}
There was contact between the exiles and other categories of Malays as well as Moors.\citep[cf.][8]{Bichsel}
\paragraph{Convicts}
``Criminals convicted for various crimes constituted the second group of deportees. [\dots].Depending on the political situation in Sri Lanka, many were pressed into military service. After serving their sentence, they were set free and could remain on the island to settle down. A steady influx of such deportees continued throughout the Dutch period [but no information about amount or origin is given in Hussainmiya]''\citep[8]{Bichsel}
\paragraph{Slaves}
``Slaves and servants mainly from the Moulccas and the Lesser Sunda Islands were brought to the island to serve the Dutch and the aristocratic deportees. Particularly in times of political unrest or anticipation of war, slaves were set free under the condition that they serve in the military''\citep[8]{Bichsel}
\paragraph{Soldiers}
``[T]he majority, however, came as soldiers in the service of the Dutch and, later, of the British''\citet[1]{Bichsel}.

From the middle of the 18^{th} century onwards, former soldiers, convicts and slaves engaged in commercial activities such as gardening, rattan weaving and petty trade. Some gained wealth. They had to pay a sum to not serve in \em uliyam \em (soccage).
In 1769, the number of the `free' Malays was high enough to have an own category for tax colleting purposes.

Some Malays fled the Dutch and served the Kandyan King.\citep[9]{Bichsel}

``The total number of Malays in Sri Lanka at the end of the Dutch period in 1795 was 2400''\citep[10]{Bichsel} maybe more.

According to Robert Percival, Malays were easy to distinguish from the other Lankan people

There were wealthy and poor Malays.

The Malays were a  community with distinct ethic identity and own places of worship
\citep[11]{Bichsel}

``From Hussainmiya's account little can be deduced about the Malays' relationship with the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. Their role as mercenaries of foreign power isolated the Malays from the Sinhala and Tamil population against whom they were compelled to fight. This fact as well as different religious beliefs prevented the integration of the Malays with these communities. A close relationship developped with the Moor community, themselves a minority organized in self-sufficient communities outsied the political mainstream. [\dots]The common religion led to a close relationship between the two communities and intermarriage with the Moors led to an early contact with the Moor dialect of the Tamil language''\citep[11f]{Bichsel}

1827: Ceylon Infantry was reorganized in the Ceylon Rifle Regiment, Malays forming majority.

Life in the SLM community evolved around the Regiment. Most families had at least one member BS19

``neighborhoods were likely to be fellow Malays BS 21. Malays worshipped in their own mosques, in which religious discussions as well as public meetings were held in Malay. In the regimental schools, children were taught to read and write Malay.'' BS21f

``The high rate of literacy in the community promoted the preservation of Malay litertature, while the continued influx of Malay-speaking immigrants, often accompanied by their families, and the opportunity for Sri Lanka Malays to travel to the Malay world in recruiting missions brought the language new impulses from the outside.''BS 21

\subsubsection{The Regiment}
\subsubsection{Dissolution of the Regiment and consequences}
``Until the end of the 19^{th} century, life in garrisons, isolated from the rest of the population, contributed to the preservation of Malay identity''\citep[1]{Bichsel}.

``The disbandment of the regiment marked a turning point in Malay society. [\dots] [C]ompetence in English, Tamil, and, to a lesser extent, Sinhala became more important than competence in Malay.''\citep[22]{Bichsel}
