\chapter{History of the Sri Lankan Malays}
The history of the Malays can be be divided according to the following events: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first Malays brought to Lanka by the Dutch
	\item the eviction of the Dutch by the British and the creation of a Malay regiment
	\item the disbandment of said regiment
	\item independence of Ceylon from the United Kingdom
\end{itemize}

This leaves us with a pre-Dutch period, the Dutch period, the period of the Regiment, the post-regimental history and the post-colonial history. I will briefly sketch major events during each period before discussing demographic and sociological developments that accompanied them. Domains which encompass more than one period are the cultural history and the development of the language. These will be presented after as a whole in the end of this section.
\section{History before the arrival of the Dutch}
Sri Lanka has seen a very rich history before the Dutch brought the first Malays to the island. Most of the history of the settlement of Lanka has not had any repercussions whatsoever on SLM and will only briefly be glossed over. 
\subsection{Ereignisgeschichte}
\subsubsection{Precolonial History}
The first known people to settle in Lanka were the Veddah. Their origin is unclear. Relations to the Adaman and Nicobar islands have been postulated.  Some genetical test indicate a link between the Veddah and the Senoi from Malaysia\citep[6]{Saldin2003}. It can surely been affirmed that the Veddah have not had any linguistic relation on the present day SLM.
  
 The Veddah could not withstand the arrival of the populaces from the Indian mainland in XXXX BC\src that announces a second phase of settleement and has proven the most influential up to now, resulting in the present cultures of Sinhalese and Ceylon Tamils.  Arab traders settled down on the Indian coast in XXXX \src and became acquainted with local tongues. Some of the Tamil-speaking descendants moved to Lanka in about 1300\src and took care of trade \citep[42]{Hussainmiya1990}. They are the ancestors of most of today's Tamil speaking Muslims in Lanka. Colonialism arrived in Lanka with the Portuguese taking XX in XXXX\src.

It is not clear, what relations existed between the Island of Sri Lanka and South Asia in the precolonial period. People from the SEAA settled in Madagascar from the 2nd century AD and it is reasonable to suppose that they stopped over in Lanka on their way. However, they left no traces. Later contact finds evidence from iconographical finds in Western Java, dated to the 5th or 6th century AD\src and an 6th century inscription found in Central Java \src \citet[5]{Bichsel}

% \begin{quote}

% From about the 13th century the Indian Muslim element, especially

% language was adopted as the mother tongue of the Sri Lankan
% Moors\citep[42]{Hussainmiya1990}
% \end{quote}

% \begin{quote}Sri Lanka lies along the trade routes from the Malay Archipelago to the Middle East and East Africa. En route, seafarers passed Sri Lanka and South India. Although, from about the 2^{nd} century, people from the Malay Archipelago began to settle in Madagascar, no archeological evidence of such an early South East Asian presence in Sri Lanka has been found. %(DeSilva)
% But a comparison of iconographical finds in Western Java has led Pierre Dupont \el %(1959)
% to postulate contact between Java and Sri Lanka in the 5^{th} or 6^{th} century, possibly even in the 2^{nd} or 3^{rd} century. Further evidence of early cultural relations between Java and Sri Lanka is provided by an 8^{th} century inscription found in central Java that refers to Sinhalese ascetics and the Abhayagiri Vih\aa ra, a famous monastery at Anur\aa dhapura \citep[5]{Bichsel}% De Casparis
% \end{quote}


According to  \citet[11]{Jayasuriya2001}, 

\begin{quotation}
	``Contact between Malaysia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka dates back at least to the 8th century when the Sailendra dynasty which originated from Java, ruled over Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Bali and Borneo. Little is known about the dynasty but the Buddhist monuments such as Borobudur were constructed during their rule. The Sailendra royaly were Mahayana Buddhists whose religious texts were written in Sanskrit \el . There were also genealogical connections between the Sailendra dynasty and the Sinhalese royalty who ruled Sri Lanka.''\citet[11]{Jayasuriya2001}
\end{quotation}

Contact between Lanka and the SEAA find evidence in old Sinhala literature from the Polonnaruwa and the Dambadeniya periods (together 1098-1293)\citep[11]{Jayasuriya2001} 

% \begin{quotation}
% ``Sinhala literary works from the Polonnaruwa Period (1098-1234) and the Dambadeniya period (1220-1293) testify to contact between the Malays and the Sinhalese''	 \citet[11]{Jayasuriya2001} 
% \end{quotation}

% \begin{quotation}
% 	``There must have been intermarriages beteween  these Buddhist Malays and the predominantly Buddhist indigenous population''\citet[2]{Jayasuriya2001}
% \end{quotation}

The Buddhist Malays from that time have not left many traces, and we can assume that they assimilated with the Sinhalese Buddhist culture if ever they stayed in Lanka. 

% \begin{quote}
%     ``The great antiquity of ocean-voyaging by the Malay race is not an unfamiliar assumption among scholars. [\dots]'''Eventually `Hambantota' comes from \em sampan \em `type of Malay boat'. The \em s \em would have been changed to \em h \em due to Sinhala influence. The present population of Malays in Hambantota dates yet from the beginning of the 19th century.\footnote{See \citet[6]{Saldin2003} for alternative etymologies} \citep[32]{Hussainmiya1990}
% \end{quote}

Cultural elements that might be traceable to them are outrigger canoes and masks, as Hussainmiya speculates:

\begin{quote}
    cultural elements may be indicative of the presence of Malay Elements in Lanka: outrigger canoes. They are not used on the Arabian side of India  Their Sinhala name \em oruwa \em might derive from  Polynesian \em Oru'u\em. Further elements of suggested influence are the masks, the way of wearing the lower garment and the crocodile cult\citep[32]{Hussainmiya1990}\citep[30f]{Hussainmiya1987}
\end{quote}

In the 13th century, Malay forces from the pensinsula made an attempt to invade Sri Lanka. Chandrabh\=anu of T\=ambralinga tried twice to get hold of the island, but his dynasty was short-lived and the Pandyans of South India installed a Pandyan ruler as the successor to his son. \citep[7]{Saldin2003}\citep[cf.][31]{Hussainmiya1987}. Today's place names Cavakacheri (Javaka-settlement) and Cavakotte (Javaka Fort) witness this invasion\footnote{Java and the Malay peninsula are normally not seen as different in Lanka.}
Malays were still Buddhist at that time and would as easily have been assimilated to Lankan culture as their grandparents some generations earlier.

\subsubsection{History during Portuguese rule}
In 15xx the Portuguese gained hold of some islands \src in the SEAA. By that time, Islam had made considerable inroads in SEAA.
In 1506, the Portuguese conquered large parts of Lanka. They stayed until they were evicted by the Dutch in 1640\src. The Portuguese wanted to spread Christian faith and kept other religion in very low regard, especially Islam. It seems implausible that the Portuguese brought Malays given their hatred for Islam.\citep[cf.][34f]{Hussainmiya1990}

\citet[6f.]{Bichsel} affirms that there is no historical evidence of a sizeable Malay community in Sri Lanka and doubts that the Portuguese, who persecuted Muslims, would have tolerated the spread of Malays in Sri Lanka. 

However \citep[26]{Powell1973} mentions that some \em Javas \em (Malays) and \em Kaffirs \em (Africans) fought for the Sinhalese king Raju in 1587 and states that they had deserted from the Portuguese. We must thus assume that at least some Malays had been brought to Lanka by the Portuguese
 \citet[5f]{Jayasuriya2001} affirms that there is evidence for contact between Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole and Malayan Dutch. He seems to imply that this must have taken place during the Portuguese period, but a later contact between SLPC speakers and Malay Dutch speakers is also conceivable.

% \begin{quotation}
% 	``Although the Portuguese Era (1505-1658) does not seem to have played a significant part in the Malay disapora in Sri Lanka, evidence fro military sources suggest that the Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole mother-tongue speakers - the \em Burghers \em (descendants of the Portuguese and the Dutch) and the \em Kaffirs \em (descendants of the Africans brought to Sri Lanka by the three successive colonial powers: the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British) had contact with people who spoke `Malayan Dutch' ''\citet[5f]{Jayasuriya2001}
% \end{quotation}


\subsection{Demographic history before arrival of the Dutch}
There was no important settlement of Malays in Lanka before the arrival of the Dutch. Chandrabh\=anu's invasion did not last long enough to give birth to a Malay community in Lanka. If any Malays were left behind after the invasion, they would have merged in their correligionist community of Sinhalese Buddhists.

\section{History during Dutch rule}
The Dutch ruled Lanka from 1640 -- 1796. The Malays that came during their reign form the origin of today's Malay population in Lanka.

\subsection{Ereignisgeschichte}
The Dutch evicted the Portuguese from Sri Lanka in 1640. During
that time, they were already controlling large parts of the SEAA and thus commanded companies of Malay soldiers. Having Malay troops in Lanka had several advantages for the Dutch: First, those were used to tropical climate and fights in the jungle\draftnote{src}, second, they were not likely to side with the Sinhalese or Tamils in any rebellion given the cultural and religious differences. 

% The Malays brought by the Dutch were the base for the actual Malay population in Lanka.\citep[cf.][40]{Hussainmiya1987}
%\citep[cf.][7]{Bichsel} 
%\begin{quote}
%The ancestors of the Sri Lanka Malays  came to Sri Lanka between 1656 and 1850 from the Dutch and the English possessions in the Malay Archipelago\citet[1]{Bichsel}.
%\end{quote}

% \begin{quote}
%     it was during these one and a half centuries  that the `Malays' from all over the Malay and Indonesian areas were brought into the island by the Dutch.

% \end{quote}



%\begin{quote}
%The first Indonesians to be brought ti Sri Lanka by the Dutch
%came subsequent to the latter's expulsion of the Portuguese power
%in 1656. These early Indonesians were referred to as
%`Easterners'or `Javanese' by the Dutch, and they can be divided
%into two broad categories: on the one hand political exiles and
%other (criminal) deportees, and on the other hand people who
%served the Dutch in various fields, mostly soldiers, but also some
%slaves\citet[?]{Bichsel}
%\end{quote}

Four different types of immigrants came to Sri Lanka, exiles, convicts, slaves and soldiers.
 
\subsubsection{Exiles}
In order to stay in control of the islands of the SEAA, the Dutch deported rebellious local regents to South Africa and Lanka. Lanka was preferred because it was closer to the SEAA. The Dutch had first taken possession of the former Portuguese colonies in the Moluccas and the lesser Sunda islands. By consequence, the first exiles came from there. In the late 17th century, there was a war of succession in Java. Following this, a number of Javanese princes were exiled to Lanka.

%\begin{quote}Many were political deportees exiled from the territories of the United East India Company for resisting Dutch domination\citet[1]{Bichsel}.\end{quote}

%\begin{quote}
%    It had been the practice of the Dutch to banish from the Netherlands West Indies rebellious rulers and princes \el if they posed a threat to their authority in the East. Outside the archipelago, Sri Lanka and the Cape of Good Hope  were the principal centres of banishment. Sri Lanka, however, seems to have been preferred by the Dutch authorities due to its proximity to the the Indonesian archipelago \citep[38]{Hussainmiya1990}
%\end{quote}

%\begin{quote}
%    some of the earliest political exiles came from the Moluccas  and other lesser Sunda islands where Dutch influence in the East had first taken root. As a result of  their involvement in the war if succession which began in the late 17th century, several Javanese princes were exiled to Ceylon. \citep[38]{Hussainmiya1990}

\subsubsection{Convicts}
Besides the exiles, a large number of convicts from the SEAA was brought to Lanka, ``serving sentences according to the gravity of their crime ranging from being kept in chains to the permission to engage in handicraft.''  \citep[44]{Hussainmiya1990}
\draftnote{when and how much?}
In 1782, the Dutch allowed minor offenders to join the ranks of the military after 1782. Other convicts were set free. They were allowed to settle in Lanka.  The  former convicts formed thus  part of the early Malay population in Lanka and the `Malay' community of Sri Lanka can be said to owe its origins partly to these Malay convict settlers. \citep[44]{Hussainmiya1990}

%\begin{quote}
%    [A host of other people were brought to Ceylon, mainly as convicts, serving sentences according to the gravity of their crime ranging from being kept in chains to the permission to engage in handicraft.

%\begin{quote}
%Criminals convicted for various crimes constituted the second group of deportees.\el.Depending on the political situation in Sri Lanka, many were pressed into military service. After serving their sentence, they were set free and could remain on the island to settle down. A steady influx of such deportees continued throughout the Dutch period [but no information about amount or origin is given in Hussainmiya]\citep[8]{Bichsel}
%\end{quote}

% \begin{quote}
% 	``It is difficult to assess the number of such convicts \el In 1732 alone there were 131 of these convicts serving the Company in Sri Lanka not to mention the others who served in the military and those who were set free and remained in the island. \citep[47]{Hussainmiya1987}
% \end{quote}

% \begin{quote}
% 	``[in1782] it was decided that, except the branded criminals, other deportees could be enlisted into the native army. Thus a good part of these convicts had the chance to mix up with their fellow easterners in the island. Those who were set free had the opportunity to raise families here and settle permanently. In this sense , the 'Malay' community of Sri Lanka can be said to owe its origins partly to these 'Malay' convict settlers''\citep[47]{Hussainmiya1987}
% \end{quote}


\subsubsection{Slaves}
A third group were slaves and servants brought mainly from the Moluccas and Lesser Sunda islands to serve the aristocratic exiles and the Dutch. Like the convicts, some of them joined the army \citep[48]{Hussainmiya1990}. They were not a very numerous group.

%\begin{quote}
%Slaves and servants mainly from the Moluccas and the Lesser Sunda Islands were brought to the island to serve the Dutch and the aristocratic deportees. Particularly in times of political unrest or anticipation of war, slaves were set free under the condition that they serve in the military\citep[8]{Bichsel}
%\end{quote}

%    [a small number of slaves was brought to SL. they mostly were from the Moluccas and the lesser Sundas. Slaves could join the army to gain their freedom \citep[48]{Hussainmiya1990}
%\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Soldiers}
The group that consituted the most important Malay influx were the soldiers. Already during the battles against the Portuguese, Malay troops were present \citep[44]{Hussainmiya1990}. Later, they formed an important part of the Dutch millitary presence in Lanka. There were garrisons in the main coastal towns of Colombo, Galle, Chillaw and Trincomalee\draftnote{structure of the army? all same place or dispersed?}. Malays were not confined to the lower rank, there is mention of a Malay captain in \citep[48]{Hussainmiya1987}.
 
 A regular supply of new recruits from Batavia was provided each year, as well as reninforcements in urgent cases \citep[48]{Hussainmiya1987}. The importance of the Malays for the Dutch army can be seen from the fact that `` [a]bout two thirds of the fighting troops were Malays'' \citep[37]{Powell1973} in 1764. From 1785 on, local, i.e. Lankan Malays were recruited into the Dutch army instead of the Moors \citep[54]{Hussainmiya1987}.

% \begin{quote}

% 	``These troops took part at the storming of Galle by Admiral Coster in 1640 and also during the siege of Colombo in 1655/1656, the Malays were given the pride of place at the storming of the Fort.

Malay soldiers are frequently mentioned in the Dutch wars against Kandy''\citep[48]{Hussainmiya1987}

\subsubsection{Free(d) Malays}
Particularly after the middle of the 18th century, the proportion of free Malay grew. Those were discharged soldiers and descendants of political exiles. There occupations included gardening rattan weaving, petty trade, domestic servants. The Malays counted as foreigners and had to perform \em Uliyam. \em Political exiles and soldiers were exempted]\citep[48f]{Hussainmiya1990}
 In 1769, the number of the `free' Malays was high enough to have an
own category for tax collecting purposes.\citep[9]{Bichsel}

\label{fig:recruits} shows the provenance of the different groups of Malays during European colonization on the map on the right hand side and a timeline of their arrival on the left hand side. Dutch are represented by orange and English by blue. Dutch sources are not very precise as for dates so that only an approximation can be given. 

We have some ideas about the provenance of the different groups of Malays brought to Lanka.

\subsubsection{exiles}
The exiles came from the Moluccas and the Lesser Sunda Islands. Later, there were also exiled Javanese princes. \citet[7]{Bichsel} also cites Bacan, Tidore, Timor, Madura and Sumatra. How much were there from each region, what language(s) might they have spoken, and how important were the exiles in the overall Malay population?

The Dutch called Malays first Oosterlingen and later Javaans. This might indicate a shift of proportions of population and goes well along with the Javanese succession wars in the late 17th century which brought more Javanese exiles to Lanka. Most of the exiles had their families with them at deportation time or they joined them later. We do not know how many exiles from each region were brought to Lanka\draftnote{do we really not?}. There should have been considerably less exiles than soldiers, though. Nobility is likely to speak a high or even literary variety of their vernacular language. In the Moluccas, this would have been AVBSVD, whereas in the Lesser Sunda islands, this would have beenn LISDJL. Javanese princes would have spoken a DFLSJF variety of Javanese.

\draftnote{?` Do we know about contacts between exiles from different regions? ?` What language would different exiles have used in inter-group contact?}

At the end of the 18^{th} century, there were about 200 exiles among a Malay population totalling around 2000 souls \citep[7]{Bichsel}. Most of the exiles lived in the 4 main coastal towns Colombo, Galle, Trincomalee, Jaffna.

\subsubsection{soldiers}
The most important contingent of Malays brought by the Dutch were soldiers.  The soldiers were mainly recruited in Batavia. At that time, Batavia was a port city with many different peoples mingling.  There are records of the following ethnic groups serving in the military: Ambonese, Bandanese, Balinese, Buginese, Javanese, Madurese, Malays, which is almost all the major ethnic groups from the SEAA \kuckn.  In Lanka, they were referred to as \em  Javaans\em, but we see now that this is dramatically simplified. The ``Neo-Indonesians'' as \citep[57]{Hussainmiya1987} calls them were the base for the Malay society in Lanka. Already in Batavia, they are likely to have developped a group identity, which would have been strengthened  in the unknown foreign country.

In Batavia, there were different \em kampungs \em for the different nationalities( \citet[48,51f]{Hussainmiya1990},\citet[cf.][11]{Hussainmiya1987}). It is nevertheless likely that intergroup communication took place. This would have been in some kind of Vehicular Malay. The Dutch need for soldiers was so dramatic that the \em kampungs \em were virtually depopulated at times \citep[56]{Hussainmiya1987}.

Depending on the military needs of the Dutch, there were more or less Malays in Lanka. Under normal conditions, there were 800 men in service, divided into 10 companies.  In 1764 the number of Malays rose to 2500.

in 1795/6 there were probably around 1400 Malays serving, comprising recruited civilians. \citet[49f]]{Hussainmiya1990} estimates the number of Malays in SL at around 2400 in 1800, possibly their highest figure \citep[54]{Hussainmiya1987} because the Dutch were anticipating a British attack and had stocked up.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
During the Dutch period, there were two main groups. First the high prestige group of the exiles who spoke SFJSDL. They made up about 10\% of the population. Second, there were the soldiers, who came from diverse ethnic backgrounds, but who most likely communicated in some kind of vehicular Malay already developed back in Batavia. These soldiers formed the most important group, and they are likely to have absorbed the smaller groups of the slaves and convicts, who could not affirm an own identity given their low prestige and often joined the ranks of the soldiers where they had to adapt to the language already in use there if ever they spoke some other own idiom.

During Dutch rule, a shift in the composition of the Malay population in Lanka took place. While there were many exiles from the Moluccas and Lesser Sundas at first, they were quickly outnumbered by exiles from the Javanese succession war and the Batavian soldiers. It seems that the Eastern community was absorbed by the Javanese community at the close of the 18th century \citep[55]{Hussainmiya1987}.  Madurese and Sumanepers, who arrived in the late 18th century would find and established society of ``Ceylon Malays'' with strong roots in Batavia which would quickly integrate them \citep[57]{Hussainmiya1987}.

\begin{quote}
	`` In Dutch times, not all the easterners who came to Sri Lanka were the followers of Islam. It is partucularly difficult to establish the religious background of the Amboinese, Balinese, and even Javanese, because among the first group, there  were a considerable number of Christians, while most of the Balinese belonged to Hindu Religion \el Nevertheless, it is quite clear that a large majority of the early Malays were followers of Islam.''\citep[58]{Hussainmiya1987}

\subsection{Sociological history under Dutch rule}
\subsubsection{Intragroup}
There were the two main groups of the exiles and the soldiers.

\citep[41]{Hussainmiya1990} affirms that the exiles were rather poor and had to sell jewels and other precious things in order to meet their expenses \src. They would no have lived in small huts though if they still had jewelry to sell.\kuckn

The exiles were not allowed to communicate with each  other . Inhowfar this was enforced remains questionable given that marriages between children of exiles were contracted. Attendance at celebrations such as births was also high \citep[43f]{Hussainmiya1987}. 

Some exiles were given ranks in the military in order to raise the moral of the Malay troops \citep[50]{Hussainmiya}. Others were given land, but this could hardly earn them a living.
\citep[45]{Hussainmiya}. 
The exiles communicated among themselves. Marriages between exiles were contracted. 

Free Malays engaged in commercial activities such as
gardening, rattan weaving and petty trade \citep[53]{Hussainmiya1987}. They counted as foreigners and hat to pay soccage.

\subsubsection{Intergroup}
\paragraph{Exiles}
Normally, only the head of a family was considered an exile, the other members of the family could move about freely. This would have facilitated contact with the local people.

The exiles are not very likely to have intermingled with the local population, given that their exile was against their will. There is however evidence that the exiles learnt something about Islam while being in Lanka, and that they brought back this knowledge once they returned to teh SEAA\src. \citep[41]{Hussainmiya1990} affirms however that the nature of the contact between the Malays and the Moors cannot be established. 




\paragraph{soldiers}
The soldiers fought for the Dutch against the Sinhalese and Malay. This makes friendly contact with those populations were unlikely. Furthermore different religious beliefs did not help.
The Malay soldiers were feared by the Sinhalese\citep[cf.][51]{Hussainmiya1987} and gambled a lot. Besides their own language, they speak Sinhala, Portuguese and Dutch. Some also spoke Tamil. Many of the soldiers also took Sinhala and Tamil wives
%\begin{quote}
%From Hussainmiya's account little can be deduced about the Malays'
%relationship with the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. Their role
%as mercenaries of foreign power isolated the Malays from the

%the integration of the Malays with these communities. A close

%relationship between the two communities and intermarriage with
%the Moors led to an early contact with the Moor dialect of the
%Tamil language\citep[11f]{Bichsel}
%\end{quote}

\paragraph{general}
the Dutch government in Ceylon  had banned public Islamic religious ceremonies, which was wy they were often held in secrecy. This can be a reason to side  with the Moors who were facing the same problem. However, \citet[41]{Hussainmiya1990} affirms that the nature of the contact with the Moors cannot be established.

Some exiles were regarded highly on returning to the SEAA because of the Islamic scholarship they had acquired in Lanka \citep[45f]{Hussainmiya1987}. This proves that there has beedn considerable cultural contact between the Malays and the Moors.

\section{History during British rule}
\subsection{Ereignisgeschichte}
The British took over from the Dutch in 179x. The Malay soldiers defended fiercely and are even said to have been the only worthwhile enemy of the British \citep[cf.][42,44]{Powell1973}. This earned them the respect of the British. From the Malay prisoners of war first sent to Madras, the British recruited many to serve in their native army in Ceylon.


\subsubsection{Governor North}
The British regarded the Malays as an exclusive soldier class. Even the Malays that had been civilians recruited as a last resort by the Dutch were granted full soldier status\draftnote{src?}. The British had a native Regiment in Ceylon which bore several names during the history of its existence: Malay Corps, His Majesty's Malay Regiment, the First Regiment, and finally the Ceylon Rifle Regiment.\draftnote{plag} 
% Military service formed a very important part of the Malay society in the 19th century, and their history can only be understood in conjunction with the regiment. [Something with the invalids' company]
The British kept on depending on Malays for their supply of native soldiers, because the Sinhalese and Tamils proved no good soldiers. But their number could not meet the needs of the British. Recruitment from abroad was encouraged and companies [?] were formed in Hambantota and Tangalle \citep[64f]{Hussainmiya1990}. In 1800, recruitment from Penang was started. This was the first time, that Malays from the Peninsula came to Lanka. The Regiment was a means to keep contact  with the SEAA.

From 1802, retired Malays were sent to the South and given land to colonize, first Hambantota, later Kirinda and Palatupana.
%1802: retired Malays sent to Hambantota, Kirinda and Palatupana to exploit the salt pans

18xx[or 179x?]\kuckn: North forms Boys' Regiment and company of invalids. Thus, most of the able bodied Malays were recruited into the army, and there were not many civilian Malays left. The percentage of recruited Malays rose to 75\%\draftnote{src?}. The social life evolved around the Regiment. The exiled princes were not recruited but given an allowance because North estimated them important for the social cohesion of the Malay population for the spiritual and cultural leadership they provided\citep[79]{Hussainmiya1990}. When some princes were made to colonize the South, they accepted to work like commoners \citep[63f]{Hussainmiya1990}.
In 1803, there was a war between the British and the Kandyan king in the inland of the island. many Malays deserted during this war.
Following this war, the Regiment only numbered 600 men \citet[72]{Hussainmiya1990}. 
Governor North left the island in 1805 to be replaced with Governor Maitland.

\subsubsection{Governor Maitland}
The successor of Gouvernour North, Governor Maitland, had a strong aversion against the Malays, probably because of the desertions during the 1803 Kandyan war. He wanted to abolish the whole regiment at first. But he did not succeed in this, not even in abolishing the invalid Malays' company, which he said to be expensive and unserviceable  \citep[67,78]{Hussainmiya1990}. He also sent back some political exiles to the SEAA, thus depriving the Malays of their cultural leaders \citep[79]{Hussainmiya1990}.

\subsubsection{Malays in Kandy}\label{sec:malayskandy}
During Dutch and British rule, some Malays had escaped the colonial forces and fled to the independent kingdom of Kandy in the central upcountry. The first Malay  reported to have done so was a royal exile who slipped into Kandy in 1742 \citep[69]{Hussainmiya1990}. In 1765/66 Baron van Eck left behind a large number of Malay soldiers when retreating to Colombo \citep[37f]{Powell1973}. There were also more deserted soldiers and runaway slaves serving the Kandyan king who were held in high esteem \citep[78]{Hussainmiya1990}.
Also the British lost many Malays to desertion in the Kandyan Wars \citet[67]{Hussainmiya1990}.

The Kandy Malays remained true to their military inclination also in Kandy and served as soldiers and guards. The Kandyan king Wickremasinghe was eager to assure their loyalty as they were providing his body guards. But Wickremasinghe lost his temper in the end of his reign \citep[71]{Hussainmiya1990} and the loyalty of the Malays was split in the 1815 war with the British \citep[83]{Hussainmiya1990}, which the Kandyans lost and thus set an end to an independent Sinhalese kingdom in Lanka.

Like Governor North and unlike Governor Maitland, Governor Brownrigg held the Malays in high esteem. He assembled all Malays into one regiment in 1813 \citep[81]{Hussainmiya1990}. He counted on his Malay Regiment to win the war against the Kandyan king in 1815 and 1818, a hope which was fulfilled \citet[68,82]{Hussainmiya1990}. However, many Malays had been sent back to the SEAA by Governor Maitland. Thus, there were not enough Malays to be recruited. Brownrigg  decided to bring recruits from abroad and chose Java. He founded the Royal Military school where the Malays were taught their own tongue and religion \citep[96]{Hussainmiya1990}.

\subsubsection{The Ceylon Rifle Regiment}
The Ceylon Rifle Regiment (CRR) was founded in 1827 . Despite the change of the name, the conditions of service remained pretty much the same. But soon after the formation of the CRR, there was a shortage in recruits from the local Malays \citep[83f]{Hussainmiya1990}. The Malays seem to have changed their attitude towards military career. A not negligeable aspect was the reduction of pay. Other reasons were the enlistment for life, which was not popular, and the service whith Sepoys and Kaffirs, two groups which the Malays held in low esteem. Furthermore, there were now many possibilities of employment in civilian professions due to the growing economy, such as government, police and plantations. So the military had no longer a monopoly on the Malay work force.  

Failing to attract local Malays, the British again tried to recruit from abroad and opened a recruiting station in Penang in 1833. This station proved successfull in the beginning, but this was not to last long. The recruiting station shifted to Singapore in 1840, was stopped in 1842, revived in 1845 and finally abandoned in 1848. The Malays recruited during this period are said to be of ``low quality'' compared to the native Malays and the recruits from Java in 1813 and 1816.

From 1847 to 1854, a Malay detachment is sent to serve in Hongkong. Service in Hongkong was not popular and casulaties were high \citep[99]{Hussainmiya1990}. The popularity of the CRR with the Malays fell further ``By the 1850s it became relatively difficult to find Malays willing to serve in the CRR.''\citep[88]{Hussainmiya1990}

In 1848, the Regiment was engaged against the rebellion. This was its last military action. The regiment continued to shrink. In 1849 the Regiment was short of 483 men. In 1851, 22 companies were reduced to 18 companies, in 1854 to 14, of which 11 were Malay. In 1865, the detachments in Hambantota, Badulla, Kurunegala and Jaffna were withdrawn \citep[101]{Hussainmiya1990}. The police department took over some of the duties from the CRR. From 1870 onwards, the Malay element was dominant in the police \citep[102f.]{Hussainmiya1990}.
 
 The costs for the Regiment were important, but it had not been in use for warfare during 25 years. So, the Regiment was disbanded in 1873 and the remaining 700 Malays were discharged. 300 joined the police
Few discharged soldiers went back to the SEAA. Even after the disbandment of the Regiment in 1873, most Malays stayed in Lanka \citep[96]{Hussainmiya1990}.

\subsubsection{History after the disbandment of the Regiment}
The disbandment of the Regiment had a major impact on the Malays. Many of them now served in the police, but contrary to the Regiment, the police was organized in small stations all over the country. So they lost a lot of their social cohesion from the regimental days. 

Some Malays chose to work in prisons as jail guards and overseers, as firemen or maybe as overseers in the inland plantations.

\subsection{Demographic history during British Rule}
\subsubsection{Demographic history in times of the Regiment}
After a period of consolidation following the British takeover, the British took the Malays in service and after all not much had changed for them. They contiuned to serve in the army. 
The total number of Malays under arms was 1000 in january 1800 before the recruiting from abroad started, then 1200 in 1801 \citet[62]{Hussainmiya1990}. The influx from recruits from abroad can be seen in table \ref{tab:RecruitsFrom Malaysia}. Note that the total number of Malays recruited from abroad during North's government is not known.

\end{table}

The influx of new Malay people was the more important as Governor Maitland had sent back a good deal of the royal exiles in 1808, thus leaving the Malays in Lanka without their ``cream''. This meant that the days of aristocratic influence were over. Some of the descendants intermarried with the local Malay population\draftnote{?`Does this imply that they did not intermarry before?} But the Malay regiment officers stepped in and saw to the cultural issues of the Lankan Malays. 
 
If, in order to have a good base for a comparison, we only consider the recruits, and not the wives and children, 647 recruits came from the SEAA and 698 from the Malay peninsula. This disregards the Malays brought from Cochin/India. We see that the amounts are about even. The peninsular recruits would have spoken some form of Malay at arrival \kuckn whereas the recruits from the SEAA would have spoken some form of SJKHDSFD\kuckn. The recruits from the peninsula are said to be of ``low quality'' \src. It is thus not very likely that they had high prestige and others would imitate their speech. As for absoulte numbers, they matched the newcomers from the SEAA, but were few against the already established Malays, who have their origins not on the peninula. An important influence of the peninsular variety of Malay is thus not to be expected.

There are some records of recruits from abroad having brought their wives and children. This was encouraged by the British \citet[12,52]{Hussainmiya1987}. It is thus to be estimated that the number of immigrants is much higher than the mere number of recruited soldiers. \draftnote{schtzen}

In 1847, some companies were sent to Hongkong. Service in Hongkong was not popular and casualties were high. [Are there linguistic consequences for that? \kuckn]

In 1850, only 10 companies of 100 men were left.

In order to make recruitment more popular, the rules of the regiment were changed and allowed henceforth retirement after 15 years of service. Few Malays made use of this and went back to Singapore or Penang. A serious impact on the Malay society in Lanka is not to be suspected.
Even after the disbandment of the Regiment in 1873, only about 80 Malays leave Ceylon for Singapore. No one is known to have left for another destination

\subsubsection{Demographic history after the disbandment of the Regiment}
The disbandment of the regiment has not had a great impact on the composition of the Malay population in Sri Lanka. Only 80 Malays went back to Singapore \citep[104]{Hussainmiya1990}. But there were no more new recruits from the East bringing fresh blood and new cultural developments to Lanka. This lacking cohesion was detrimental to the Malay society. And while the number could be maintained, the degree of internal organization and cohesion was a lot less than during the CRR's days. The families had lost their great point of common interest, and the new jobs in the police or on the plantations involved work on a smaller scale in which one would meet a lot less Malays every day than before.
Even if many Malays served in the police, it was not an exclusive Malay domain like the Regiment, and Sinhala or Tamil officers would have forced the use of English, Sinhalese or Tamil in the office. Furthermore, the critical mass for maintaining a language might not have been attained by the smaller police stations.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
During the time of the Regiment, the Malay saw an important portion of their fellows leave, the aristocrats sent back in 1808. Governour Maitland did not recruit more Malays, which had the number of enlisted Malays sink to 800. Governour Brownrigg wanted a strong Malay Regiment and perpetrated a massive recruitment, first from Java and after the British had lost Java from Penang and Singapore. During 25 years, 123456 new recruits joined the ranks of the Sri Lanka Malays, about evenly from Java and the peninsula. The Javanese were regarded higher though. 

It was more and more difficult to find recruits in the East. The number of soldiers decreased. After 25 years without belligerous activity, the CRR was disbanded. While this did not entail a back-migration to the SEAA, it stopped the arrival of ``fresh blood'' to Lanka and deprived the Malays of an important domain for using the Malay language.

\subsubsection{general}
The Malay can be said to have developped a distinct identity in the beginning of the 19th century both different from Lankans and Indonesians \citet[11]{Hussainmiya1987}.
Governor North classified the Malays into 3 groups: princes, soldiers and robbers. The latter were soldiers that had deserted because of low pay. The other two groups seemed to be well integrated into society. They are respected for their zeal which surpasses the Sinhalas' and the Moors'.
The exiles formed an important part of the Malay society and they ``lent a certain amount of cohesion, reflected glory and guidance to its members''\citep[79]{Hussainmiya1990}, but a good part of them was sent back in 1808.
The military officers then assumed the role of community leaders. They were well respected in the Regiment, even among British officers, as well as in the community. Until about 1850 the Regiment formed a central part of the Malay society with everything revolving around it. Security, solidarity and understanding among the famlilies characterized the live in the cantonment. Intermarriage among the Regiment was frequent. The social status of a community member could be evaluated by the number of officers attending his wedding \draftnote{or rank or name}. The houses were built close to the military administration center, as was the mosque where worships were held in the Malay language. 

The Regiment was bound by strong kinship ties. 
Many Malay families depended on the regiment as their only source of income \citep[78]{Hussainmiya1990}. Many soldiers joined because of family tradition.
The Malays had a certain sentiment of superiority regarding the Sepoys and Kaffirs.\draftnote{and also the Sinhalese and Tamils??}. Retired soldiers were either given land in the south or cash money. Malays seem to have prefered cash unless the land was close to the cantonment (Kampung Pensen in Kandy). This indicates the close ties and the cohesiveness of the community.

While the Regiment provided cultural and religious support for the Malays, the actual living conditions of the soldiers seem  to have been pretty poor. We  only have good  knowledge about the sociological circumstances of the Malays living in Colombo and Kandy. But in the South, things seem to have been worse.

The attractiveness of the Regiment began to decline in the 1820s. After 1850, the number of free Malays (\em Orang Priman\em) went up. New domains of work were the police, the firemen, other security related jobs, plantations, departments and offices. Generally, little is known about the activities of those people.

The cultural leadership of the Regiment was challenged towards the end of the CRR (1873). In an argument about the position of the Imam in the Malay mosques, the soldiers could not impose their candidate, and a certain kind of schism occured with military Malays and civilians attending different services. 

During the time of the Regiment lived in some kind of more or less autark community in the garrisons and their isolation aided the preservation of their identity \citep[1]{Bichsel}.

\subsubsection{regiment}
The Malays were highly regarded in the regiment, also by the British officers. A career from a Half-pay-boy to a captain was possible, contrary to European officers, who were taken from the military academy and never from the low ranks \citep[122]{Hussainmiya1990}. The Malays had their ``own'' regiment from 18xx\kuckn which was the pivot of their community around which everything evolved. Children could attend the school of the Regiment and become half=pay boys later before entering the ranks of the CRR whereas old people were taken care of by the Invalids' Company.

In 1812, the first military school for Malay boys was founded. Their number rose to 5 until 1860 \citep[99]{Hussainmiya1990}. Officers could order their soldiers to attend school. Malay parents sent their children to this regimental school, even if they were not in the military. The education provided was excellent and included Malay language \citep[144]{Hussainmiya1990}, Tamil and English \citep[96]{Hussainmiya1990} but no Chritian religious education\src. in the 19th century, the literacy rate among Malays was the highest among all ethnic group in Ceylon\src.

\begin{quote}

\subsubsection{work}
Civilian Malays would engage in the following occupations:

      book-keepers.


Police service proved particularly popular, maybe because of the similarity to military work. 90\% of the police sergeants in Colombo were Malay in 1833 . In the countryside, the Malays were more of a minority. In the tea estates, the Indian Coolies were a more important minority \citep[90f]{Hussainmiya1990}.

\section{Malay settlements}
During Dutch times, Malay regiments were stationed in the four main coastal towns of Colombo, Galle, Trincomalee and Chillaw \src 
Kandy was still independent during that time. Some Malays had deserted to Kandy and served under the Kandyan king. See page \pageref{sec:malayskandy}.
After the British had vanquished the Dutch and the Kandyans, the main Malay settlements were Colombo and Kandy. In 1802, the Malay settlement in Hambantota was founded, followed shortly by Kirinda and Palatupana not far away.

There were further detachments in the towns already inhabited by Malays during Dutch times and in Badulla, that had been under Kandyan rulership until 18XX \kuckn. Generally, the Malays were made to live close to the colonial centres of administration.
Following the 1848 rebellion, special detachments were set up in Kurunegala and Matale
In 1860, there were 5 companies in Colombo, 3 in Kandy, 2 in Galle, 2 in Trincomalee, one in Badulla and  the Sepoy company in Jaffna. In addition, detachments of soldiers from Colombo or Kandy or Galle were sent to Puttalam, Kurunegala, Hambantota and Chilaw.
In 1865 the Military Commission recommended the closing of all CRR stations for reasons of economy, except those of Colombo, Kandy, Galle, and Trincomalee.\draftnote{plag}

\end{figure}

Inside Colombo, there were two main quarters for Malays, which were home to the different ethnic groups, i.e. common Malays in Wolfendhal and exiles in the adjoining quarter known as \em Kampung Pangeran \em or Princes' quarters. It seems that while there was a separation between the two groups, they still lived close enough to interact.

In the beginning of the 19th century, Slave island (aka \em Kampung Kertel \em) became an important Malay quarter in Colombo following the installation of an administrative block, officers' mess, married men's quarters, a bachelors' mess, military school, and a parade ground.

In Kandy the main Malay quarter was Bogambara where the regiment was stationed. Next to it, there was \em Kampung Penson \em or Pensioners' quarters \kuckn Civilian Malays and Moors lived in the Katukelle suburb.

But they were required to perform certain compulsory civil duties such as building dams and cultivating land, in accordance with local custom, which they disliked \citep[82]{Hussainmiya1990}.

They resided in the Katukelle area in very modest housing \citet[70]{Hussainmiya1990}.

\section{Cultural History}
\subsection{Literature}
We do not know about cultural achievements of the Malays before the British period. If there was literary activity, it could not have been widespread and be confined to religious texts \citep[143]{Hussainmiya1990}. During the Regiment, there was literary production in Malay, newspapers as well as artistic work. Artisitic work comprised adaptions of traditional topoi as well as the creation of own poems.

Genres found in Malay literatures are: religious kitabs, books on magic, sorcery and divination, catechism and prayer, family trees and personal memoirs \citep[135]{Hussainmiya1990}. There is a penchant towards religious, particularly mystic literature made for specialists.
The genre of `Syair' enjoyed particular popularity \citep[140]{Hussainmiya1990}.
There was no history of the SEAA dynasties. This can be understood as a sign of the affirmation of own identity \citep[140]{Hussainmiya1990}.

Literature was written in Malay. No other SEA language is attested. Poets used the Jawi script, also called Gundul. This name has a Javanese etymology, which might indicate that the exiles had brought literature to Lanka.

The authors were mainly retired soldiers which can be inferred from the fact that most manuscripts were found in the possession of descendents of soldiers.

Malay literature is not only to be read but also to be recited. The Regiment provided a frame for this. With the disbandment of the Regiment, this kind of literary (inter)action became much  more difficult. The poets moved away in search of work and it was difficult to have them meet.

There was exchange of books between Lanka and the SEAA, including grammars and dictionaries.

Literary interest was fostered by the British by the creation of a library-like recreation room for Malay officers \citep[146]{Hussainmiya1990}.

Literary activity stops in the beginning of the 20th century. This is because the last officers educted in the regimental schools died out, and the younger members of the community did not know how to write Malay. In their new civil occupation, knowledge of English and Sinhala or Tamil was more important.

Literary activity seems to have been confined to Colombo and Kandy.  \em Kampung Katukelle \em and \em Kampung Pensen \em are mentioned frequently as places of copying the manuscripts originated in Kandy.


Two newspapers were issued in Lanka, \em Alamat Langkapuri \em and  \em Wajah Selong\em. The former was popular with the established Malay population while the latter was preferred by the more recent arrivals \citep[156]{Hussainmiya1990}.

Cultural authority was exerced by priests and officers.\citep[138]{Hussainmiya1990}


The promoters of cultural acitivity in the Malay language were mainly retired soldiers. They kept up their literary interest after the disbandment of the Regiment, but when they eventually died, no one would replace them and the Malay literary tradition ikn Arab script died with them.

In 1906, the first literary work in Roman script is published \citep[149]{Hussainmiya1990}.

\subsection{Relation to the Moors}
The Malays were lucky to find the Moors in Sri Lanka, an ethnic group that shared their islamic faith, and furthermore also belonged to the Sufistic branch. It is to be expected that these two islamic minorities offered each other support. This is a common assumption in the literature on SLM, even more since contemporary Malays are very close to the Moors in culture. The timing of this assimilation is not easy for lack of historical records. 


Some evidence for contact during the Dutch period is the fact that the Moors  were suspected to have helped a Javanese prisoner to get secret messages across in the Dutch periodd \citep[46]{Hussainmiya1987}. Furthermore, the Malays that went back to the SEAA knew more about Islam than they did before, a knowledge they could hardly have acquired from Buddhists or Hindus. However, we know very little about the first contacts, as Hussainmiya states:

\begin{quote}
	``the details of the nature of mutual contacts between [the Malays and the Moors] cannot be documented''\citep[44]{Hussainmiya1987}
\end{quote}

It is sure that the Malay held their own religious services from 1769 \citep[53]{Hussainmiya1987} in their own tongue after being well settled in Lanka.

\begin{quote}
	``As the Malay community grew in numbers, and with the patronage extended by the colonial rulers, their religious need were fulfilled according to Malay traditions. As the Malays claimed, special mosques for their congregations were set up in the Malay-majority townships, while they were ministered by special Malay Khatibs or priests (as styled by the Malays). The Malays also had their own religiuos Kitabs and legal texts written in [t]he Malay language.'' \citet[19]{Hussainmiya1987}
\end{quote}

Religion was clearly a domain where the Malays affirmed their identity. Of course, the Moors were fellow Muslims, but it seems that the mosque was not so much a place of interethnic contact than a place of affirmation of group identity. Influence through religion could have taken place before 1769 or after 1930 when Tamil began to replace Malay as the language of the mosque. We will return to this question later, when we will discuss the linguistic evidence for early or late Tamil influence.

\subsection{The question  of intermarriage}
Today, many Malays in Lanka count Sinhalese, Tamils or Moors among their forefathers. It is assumed throughout the literature that already in the early days, Malays intermarried, mainly with the Moors. According to \citet[19]{Hussainmiya1987} this has led to indistinctness of Malay and Lankan physical features. In the early days, there were not enough Malay women for all mercenaries, so the soldiers had to marry Lankan women. Their choice would then fall on Moor women because of the shared religion. The change towards Indian syntax that we observe in SLM would be brought about by those wives' incorrect acquisition of the language of the soldiers. It is assumed that the language change was very  We will return to the linguistic facts, motivations and sources of innovation later in this book.

The main authors on SLM are Anne Bichsel and Ian Smith. Both take their historic data from \draftnote{Vorname?} Hussainmiya and conclude that intermarriage between Malays and Tamils was frequent. This is also Hussainmiya's thesis. Let's take a look at the facts that Hussainmiya presents:

There is a citation from XYZ Schwitser \kuckn from 1xxx
\begin{quote}
	``The wives, which in part are Amboinese, in part Singulayans, and Malabarians''\citet[50]{Hussainmiya1987}
\end{quote}

Malabarians is an old term for Tamils. We see that there is indeed mention of intermarriage between Malays and Tamils, but the same is true for Singhalese. Some Malays had brought their wives from the SEAA.

\begin{quote}
	``Schwitser did not mention about the religious background of the Amboinese, and it may be that they were not followers of Islam, which explains partly why only Sinhalese and Malabar (Tamil) wives are mentioned in this case. Or it may be that the `Moorish' women were included in the racial terms of `Malabaris'.''\citep[68, foonote 68]{Hussainmiya1987}
\end{quote}

There are furthermore Dutch civil records, called \em tombos\em\footnote{Dutch has a dental stop in the beginning of this word which is associated with \graphem{th} in Lankan English. The correct spelling is nevertheless without \graphem{h}.} which point to marriages between Malays and Moors in the Dutch period. But if bride and groom are both Muslims, it is difficult to establish from historical records whether a given wife/husband was Malay or Moor given that both ethnic groups have a preference for Arabic names. Mohamed Rahaman can be Moor or Malay. Identification of Sinhalese and Hindu Tamils is somewhat easier are easy because a name like Sunil Jayawardhena  can only be born by a Sinhalese, and Murugan Adaikalanathan can only be Tamil. For intermarriage to be established, we have to have positive evidence that a Malay married a Moor. Some names are only born by Malays, such as Bangsajayah. But if Mr. Bangsajayah marries Fatima Hussein, we still do not know if this is a case of intermarriage. Fatima could be Malay or Moor. There are no names carried exclusively by Moors\kuckn.

Unfortunately, the exact \em tombos \em where Hussainmiya found his evidence are not revealed so that it is difficult to assess this question.

The evidence for predominant intermarriage with Moors rather than with Sinhalese receives a further rueckschlag\kuckn by another source cited by Hussainmiya

\begin{quote}
    Malays are feared by the Sinhalese and gamble a lot. They speak their own language, Sinhala, Portuguese and Dutch. Soldiers also spoke Sinhala and Tamil [no src]. Many of the soldiers also took Sinhala and Tamil wives \citep[45]{Hussainmiya1990}\draftnote{Malay already creole H47}
\end{quote}

It seems that the Malays spoke Portuguese and Dutch, which were the colonial languages, next to their own language. But the Lankan language mentioned is Sinhala and not Tamil. Hussainmiya goes on to say that the soldiers also spoke Tamil, but he cites no source, so this migth be pure conjecture.



It is without doubt that after the disbandment of the Regiment cohesion between the Malay eroded and that in the process there was a lot of marriage with other ethnic groups, i.e. Sinhalese, Hindu Tamils and Moors. This process gained momentum in the 20th century, and even the most important Malays of the most reputed families had undergone intermarriage

\section{Language Issues}

Linguistic data reflect Moluccan Malay, Javanese, Jakartanese and Tamil components \citet[24]{Adelaar1991}.

\subsection{Language(s) of the first Malay immigrants}
[Moors, Arab and Tamil]
\begin{quote}
The Malays belonged to various ethnic groups. No one group was strong enough to impose its language, so the lingua franca of the Malay Archipelago, Malay, was used for communication within the SLM community.\citep[cf.][12]{Bichsel}.
\end{quote}

\begin{quotation}
	``What  kind of Malay was spoken by the Jacanese and other diverse peoples who were briyght to Sri Lanka from the Dutch East Indies? It could hradly be enaythin other than the Vehicular Malay wwhich had for vernturies seved as a lingua france of [the SEAA]. This lingua franca was/is based in spoken low Malay rather than the high varieties which gave rise to the national standards \el. The term ``Bazaar Malay'', which has also been used to refer to this variety, implies a much narrower domain of use than the languages actually had (and continues to  have) and is also uesd in other senses (Paauw 2003); \nocite{Paauw2003} hence I believe the term Vehicular Malay is to be prefered. Vehicular Malay was not and is not a monlithic variety, and ther was clearly some regioanl differentiation. In particular, among the varieties of Vehicular Malay braought to Stri Lanka, Betwai, the low Malau of the Batacia area, would have been strongly represented, since Batavia served as a staging groung for troops being sent to Ceylon.''\citet[14f.]{SmithRH}

\subsection{Dating of Influences and Influencing from Lankan Languages}
It is sure that the language spoken by the Malays in the 17th century has changed considerably in the last 3 centuries to become the language that is spoken today in the SLM communities. The language has become considerably less Malayo-Polynesian and considerably more Lankan. Not much research has been undertaken on  the timing of these changes.

To get from the intial state of the language (S_0) to  the state of today S_{now}\footnote{Members of a community do not all make use of recent changes. Some are 	 quicker to adopt them, some are more conservative %\citet{Milroy}. 
Thus, S_0 as well as S_{today} are generalizations.}
, there are a basically three possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
    	\item the language changed steadily over time
    	\item the language changed abruptly at one point (or several) in time   
   	\item there were times of quicker language change and times of less change
\end{enumerate}
%
\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics{pics/lgchangegraph}
	\caption{Three types of language change}
	\label{fig:lgchangegraph}
\end{figure}
%
Given the vicissitudes of the Malay history in Lanka, a steady change does not seem probable.
If there was a very abrupt language change, it must have been motivated by sociohistoric events of magnitude\src. One of these events is certainly the arrival of the first Malays in Lanka, other possibilities are the eviction of the Dutch by the British, the disbandment of the Regiment and independence of Sri Lanka\kuckn.

How likely was abrupt language change at these four points in time? The first settlers to arrive were exiles. Exiles do not leave their country of origin willingly. They prefer to stay in their homeland. The exiles (\em bannelingen\em) in Lanka were insurgent leaders from the SEAA. They fought against Dutch rulership and for independence. As such, they are likely to value their own culture very highly. Furthermore, they hope to set again foot in their homelands. This makes them not very likely to innovate or adopt linguistic changes innovated by others. 

The exiles were the Malay `elite' in Lanka\src. They numbered about 10\% of the population. At least they would not have undergone a major and abrupt linguistic change. They were serving as a guideline for the other groups, with whom they interacted. Some change is likely to have occured, but not of a very abrupt nature.

The British takeover from the Dutch was rather smooth for the Malays, who quickly reassumed their old role as mercenaries. The language of the military changed from Dutch to English. The two European languages being fairly similar in structure, and fairly remote from Malay or either Lankan language, a major impact of that is not to be expected.

The disbandment of the Regiment caused major distorsions in Malay society. They lost their hearth in the Regiment, their social cohesion and many moved from of the garrison town to other places to find work. This changed the sociolinguistic setting in a more catastrophic way then the British takeover. With the sociolinguistic setting totally screwed up\kuckn, major Lankan inroads in the Malayn system were all too possible. Still there were the old officers caring about the language, so that a neat and decisive language change is not very likely.

Independence from the United Kingdom, nationalist movements and the promotion of the infamous ``Sinhala only'' law in 19XX \src also had an impact on the sociolinguistic setting. School lessons were now in Sinhala, so the Malay children had to learn this language. They could no longer attend the English medium schools\kuckn. On the other hand, English was still the language of economic ascendance. Many Malay families opted thus for English as the language spoken at the home to provide their children with good future opportunities\src. This was to the disadvantage of Malay, and the source of language attrition that we observe today. Linguistic change in the post-colonial era was surely major, but not abrupt as it was only the younger generation that lost knowledge of Malay, while the parents still were in command of the language, but limited its use. Major Sinhala influence is likely to date from that period.

I conclude that no abrupt change happened at any of these four occasions (first settlement, Britsh rule, disbandment of the regiment, independence.)

By exclusion of the first two possibilities, the change must have been gradual, with periods of heavy change alternating with periods of less change. I will proceed to show that the periods of the most important changes were 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the late 17th century: consolidation of a Lankan vehicular Malay
	\item 1873+: dispersal of the community, loss of cohesion: major change
	\item 19XX: forced introduction of Sinhala: major change
\end{enumerate}

	``Smith and Paauw (2004) \nocite{SmithEtAl2004}  demonstrate that literacy in the Sri Lanka Malay community is closely associated with the period during the 19^{th} century when Malay educatio was provede to the soldiers of the Ceylon Rifles regiment, and Hussainmiya makes clear that the target language was indeed Standard Malay (Hussainmiya 1978:40, 1986:20)\nocite{Hussainmiya1978manuscripts, Hussainmiya1986}. Thus 19^{th} century written Sri Lanka Malay documents reveal nothing about earlier spoken Sri Lanka Malay, except w[h]ere occasional lapses allow the low variety to leak through, and cannot be taken as evidence for recent Tamilization. \citet[18]{SmithRH}
