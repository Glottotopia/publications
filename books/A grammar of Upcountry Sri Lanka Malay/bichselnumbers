The exiles came from the Moluccas and the Lesser Sunda Islands.
Later, there were also exiled Javanese princes. \citet[7]{Bichsel}
also cites Bacan, Tidore, Timor, Madura and Sumatra. The Javanese
succession wars in the late 17th century brought more Javanese
exiles to Lanka. Most of the exiles had their families with them
at deportation time or they joined them later. We do not know how
many exiles from each region were brought to Lanka\draftnote{do we
really not?}. There should have been considerably less exiles than
soldiers, though.


There are records of the following ethnic groups
serving in the military: 
Ambonese, 
Bandanese, 
Balinese, 
Buginese,
Javanese, 
Madurese,
 Malays,
