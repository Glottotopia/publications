This book is the result of the workshop on Electronic Grammaticography held in conjunction with the 2nd International Conference on Language Description and Conservation at the University of Hawai'i in February 2011. I would like to thank the organizers of the ICLDC conference for accepting this workshop and for taking care of the local organization. I would furthermore like to express my gratitude towards the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Linguistics, whose funding and flexibility made it possible for this workshop to be held in conjuction with ICLDC.
