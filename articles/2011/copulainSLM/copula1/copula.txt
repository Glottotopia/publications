Abstract


1 Introduction


Languages with copulas are widely known in Europe and beyond, but languages
without a copula are also frequently encountered. If languages without a copula
develop one over time, the source is normally either a former locational verb or
a deictic (Stassen 1997:91). In this paper, I want to highlight yet another source
for a copula, namely the participle of the verb COME, which has grammaticalized
into a copula in Sri Lanka Malay.

I will first give some information on Sri Lanka Malay (Section 2) and the
types of copula sentences we find in that language (Section 3). I will then show
that neither other varieties of Malay nor the contact languages Sinhala and Tamil
provide models for the development of this particular copula in Sri Lanka Malay
(Section 4). I then discuss common sources for the grammaticalization of copulas
in Section 5 and common targets of grammaticalization for the verb COME in
Section 6, showing that the particular combination COME!copula is not attested.


2 Sri Lanka Malay


Sri Lanka Malay is the language of the descendents of soldiers, exiles, convicts
and slaves who were brought to the island by the colonial powers of the Dutch
and the British between roughly 1650 and 1850 (Hussainmiya 1990). The grammar
of the language has changed dramatically ever since (Adelaar 1991, Smith
et al. 2004, Ansaldo 2008, Nordhoff
2009) and has shed most of its Austronesian origins to align with the Sri Lankan sprachbund (Bakker 2006), although some
traces of Malay grammar still remain (Slomanson 2006). For instance, the language
has changed from SVO to SOV and from prepositional to postpositional.
The language has developed more than 20 new bound morphemes, mainly for
the marking of TAM and case, which is virtually unheard of in other parts of the
Malay world. Most of the changes the language has undergone since its arrival on
the island 350 years ago were triggered by language contact. The copula, however,
does not seem to have a clear origin in any contact language or any historical
variety of Malay.

3 The Copula in Sri Lanka Malay


The copula in Sri Lanka Malay is homophonous to the conjunctive participle of the
verb dhaathang ‘come’. The Sri Lanka Malay verb can take a number of prefixes,
one of them being the conjunctive participle. This form is used to indicate that the
event depicted in the clause thus marked is prior to the event in the main clause.
In this sense, it is similar to an English construction like Having done X, having
done Y, finally Z happened. An illustration of this form is given in (1).

(1) a. Oorang pada asà-pìrrang,
man pl
cp-wage.war
‘After having waged war’
b. derang=nang asà-banthu,
3pl=dat cp-help
‘and after having helped them’
c. siini=jo su-cii˘n˘ggal.
here=emph past-settle
‘the people settled down right here.’ (K051222nar03)

Alternatives to the form with asà-shown in (1) are the form with =apa shown
in (2) and the form with both asà-and =apa, shown in (3). These three forms
seem to be functionally equivalent.

(2) a. Oorang pada thiikam=apa
  man pl=dat
  shoot=cp
  ‘People having been stabbed,/People were stabbed and’
b. oorang pada=nang thee ˘mbak=apa
  man pl
  stab=cp
  ‘people having been shot,/people were shot and’
c. se=dang bannyak creeveth pada su-aada.
  1s=dat much trouble pl past-exist
  ‘I had a lot of problems.’ (K051213nar01)

(3) a. Siithu asà-blaajar=apa,
	there cp-learn=after
      ‘After having learned there,’
    b.thaaun nnamblas=ka se skuul asà-luppas=apa,
      year sixteen=loc 1s school cp-leave=after
      ‘after having left the school at 16,’

c.
pukuran asà-caari anà-pii.
work cp-find past-go
‘I looked for work and went (away).’ (K060108nar01)
The Sri Lanka Malay copula is built around the lexical verb dhaathang ‘come’
in its conjunctive participle form. All three forms mentioned above are possible
for the copular use. The following three examples illustrate this.

(4)	Se=ppe naama asàdhaathang Cintha Sinthani.
	1s=poss name copula Chintha Sinthani.
	‘My name is Chintha Sinthani.’ (B060115prs04)



(5) Se=ppe baapa dhaathangapa  Jinaan Samath.
    1s=poss father copula	Jinaan Samath.
    ‘My father was Jinaan Samath.’ (N060113nar03)
(6) Estate=pe field ocer asàdhaathangapa kithang=pe kaake
    estate=poss field ocer copula 1pl=poss grandfather.
    ‘The estate field ocer was our grandfather.’ (N060113nar03)

The three examples above illustrate the use of (asà)dhaathang(apa) as a copula.
Any of the three forms mentioned could also be used as a conjunctive participle
proper when combined with dhaathang ‘come’, as shown in the following
three examples.

(7) a. Moonyeth pada=le asà-dhaathang
	monkey pl=addit cp-come
	‘The monkeys would go and’
    b. creeveth athi-kaasi.
      trouble irr-give
      ‘cause (some other) trouble.’ (K070000wrt01)

(8) a. oorang mlaayu siithu=dering dhaathang=apa
	man malay there=abl come=after
	‘The Malay men came from there and’
    b.  cinggala raaja=nang=le anà-banthu
	Sinhala king=dat=addti past-help
      ‘helped the Sinhalese king.’ (K051206nar04)

(9) a. incayang islaam=nang asà-dhaathang=apa
	3s.polite Islam=dat cp-come=cp
	‘He came to Islam.’
    b. inni siigith=nang asà-dhaathang
      prox mosque=dat	cp-come
      ‘and came to the mosque.’
    c. giini girja
      like.this make
      ‘and does like this (=observes Islamic rites).’ (K051220nar01)

The interpretation as involving an event of coming is mandatory in examples
(7)-(9), but impossible in examples (4)-(6). We are thus dealing with polysemy of
the form (asà)dhaathang(apa).

In the languages of the world which have a copula, it is normally used for
one or more types of non-verbal predicates (Stassen 1997). The predication types
which are often found to require support by a copula are property assignment
(John is tall), class inclusion (John is a doctor), existence (There is a solution)
and location (John is in Dubai). Additionally, identification (The murderer was the
butler; I am John) and specification (The president is Obama) also often require
the use of a copula (Hengeveld 1992). This is actually exactly what we find in
English, where the copula ‘to be’ is present in all these cases.

In Sri Lanka Malay, the copula is mainly used for naming people and for indications
of group membership. Property assignment or location are not areas which
trigger the use of the copula. Among these uses, naming is the most common one
and has been illustrated in (4) and (5) above. Apart from naming, the copula is
most frequently used for indicating membership in ethnic, professional or gender
classes or groups. These three uses are given in (10)-(12). The three forms with
asà-, =apa and asà-...=apa appear to be used indiscriminately for these functions.

(10) a. Se=ppe daughter-in-law=pe mother asàdhaathang bìnggaaliethnicgroup.
	1s=poss daughter-in-law=poss mother copula Bengali
	‘My daughter-in-law’s mother is Bengali.’
      b. Ithukapang daughter-in-law=pe father asàdhaathang Malay
	then daughter-in-law=poss father copula mlaayuethnicgroup.
	‘Then my daughter-in-law’s father is Malay.’ (K051206nar08)

(11) [Seelong=nang duppang duppang anà-dhaathang mlaayu] asàdhaathang oorang ikkangprofession.
     [Ceylon=dat before before past-come Malay] copula man fish
      ‘The Malays who came to Ceylon very early were fishermen.’ (K060108nar02)


(12) Kàthama aanak dhaathangapa klaakigender.
      first child copula male
    ‘My oldest child is a boy.’ (G051222nar01)

Another use frequently found use is the indication of kinship relations, another
type of class membership. Example (13) illustrates this.

(13) Baapa=pe umma asàdhaathang kaake=pe aadekin.
      Father=poss mother copula grandfather=poss younger.sibling.
      ‘My paternal grandmother was my grandfather’s younger sister.’ (K051205nar05)

All the functions mentioned above, with the exception of naming, have in
common that they indicate group membership. Another function is the use of
the copula in identificational or specificational sentences. The following two examples
show the use of the copula to further specify or identify the nature of a
problem.

(14) [Itthu vakthu kithang=nang nya-aada] asàdhaathang ini JVP katha hathu problem.
      dist time 1pl=dat past-exist copula prox JVP quot indef problem.
      ‘What we had at that time was the so-called JVP-problem.’ (K051206nar10)


(15) suda karang [kithang=nang aada problem] dhaathangapa  kithang=pe aanak pada mlaayu thama-oomong
     thus now 1pl=dat exist problem copula 1pl=poss  child pl Malay neg.nonpast-speak
      ‘So, the problem we are having now is that our children do not speak Malay.’ (G051222nar01)

To sum up, of the functions commonly associated with the copula, ‘class membership’
seems to be central for the Sri Lanka Malay case, while identification is
another use. Identificational uses of the copula are very common as far as naming
is concerned, but far less common for the types of identification and specification
illustrated with examples (14)-(15).

The domains of property assignment and location do not seem to trigger the
use of the copula in Sri Lanka Malay, as illustrated in (16) and (17).

(16) Theembok (*asàdhaathang) puuthi
      wall copula	white
    (intended reading ‘The wall is white.’)
(17) Tony (*asàdhaathang) Kluu˘mbu=ka
    Tony copula Colombo=loc
    (intended reading ‘*Tony is in Colombo.’, possible reading ‘Tony has arrived
in Colombo.’)

While class inclusion as described above often does show the copula, but it
is by no means obligatory. The copula can be left out in all the sentences above
without aecting truth conditions. This means that together with the sentence in
(11), (18) is also grammatical.

(18) [Seelong=nang duppang duppang anà-dhaathang mlaayu] ∅  oorang ikkang.
      Ceylon=dat before before past-come Malay] man fish
      ‘The Malays who came to Ceylon very early were fishermen.’


It appears that the use of the copula is conditioned more by considerations
of information structure than by syntax or semantics. Especially topic-comment
structures seem to trigger the use of the copula (cf. Li & Thompson 1977:420).
The stretch preceding the (asà)dhaathang(apa) is the topic, while the following
portion is the comment.

It is not necessary for the topic to be nominal. In (19), we see an adverbial
topic dovulu ‘in former times’, the comment on which is preceded by abbisdhaathang,
an idiolectal variant of asàdhaathang. In (20), we have a spatial topic
siini ‘here’ instead of a temporal topic.

(19)  dovulu abbisdhaathang muuka thama-thuuthup
      earlier copula face neg.irr-close
      ‘Earlier, the women would not cover their faces.’ (K061026prs01)
(20)	Siini dhaathangapa mixed, mixed community
	here copula mixed mixed community
	‘What we get here is a mixed, a mixed community.’ (G051222nar04)

Occasionally, the comment can be quite elaborate as in the following two examples.

(21) Itthu abbisdhaathang custard powder=dering=jo arà-kirja.
     dist copula custard powder=abl=emph non.past-make
    ‘As for this one, it is such that it is made with custard powder.’

(22) a. Sepakthakrowpe rules dhaathangapa
	sepaktakrow=poss rules copula
	‘The Sepaktakrow rules are as follows:’
     b. inni hathu badminton court=ka arà-maayeng
	prox indef badminton court=loc non.past-play
	‘You play it on a badminton court;’
      c. game hatthu itthe same measurement ambel=apa; height=le  same=jo
	  game indef dist same measurement take=after height=additsame=emph
      ‘(For) a game, you take the same measurements, and then the height
(of the net) is also the same.’ (N060113nar05)

Furthermore, use of the copula seems to be strengthened by the presence of
loanwords in the sentence, as is already evident from the preceding example. Most
of the Malays have an above average command of English for the Sri Lankan
context, and it cannot be excluded that the use of lexical material from English
(loanwords) activates grammatical structures of English as well, in this case the
requirement for a copula in predications of class membership.


4 Where does the copula come from?

The copula is both synchronically and diachronically analyzable as conjunctive
participle of the lexical verb dhaathang ‘come’. The first Malays who arrived in
Ceylon in the 17th century communicated in Vehicular Malay, a trade language
used in and around the Indonesian archipelago (Smith 2003, Smith et al. 2004).
The language has changed considerably in the last three centuries and has typologically
converged towards the local languages Tamil and Sinhala (Smith et al.
2004, Smith & Paauw 2006, Ansaldo 2005, 2008, Nordhoff
2009). Given these
historical facts, three possible origins for the copula can be suggested: Indonesian
varieties of Malay, and Sinhala or Tamil. In this section, I will discuss the copula-
like structures we find in these languages and the possibility of their influence om
the development of Sri Lanka Malay.

4.1 Copulas in Indonesian varieties
In Indonesian there exist two copulas, adalah and ialah, which are restricted to
very formal varieties Sneddon (2006:98f) informs us that


 [t]he copulas adalah and ialah optionally occur in F[ormal ]I[ndonesian]
 to link a subject and nominal predicate, and sometimes an adjectival
 predicate [...] with adalah being considerably more common than
 ialah.
 Adalah also occurs in C[olloquial ]J[akarta ]I[ndonesian], although
 it is very rare; in about half the texts it did not occur. In most of
 the others it occurred with very limited frequency. It was only in the
 meetings and in the two most formal interviews [...] that it occurred
 frequently. [...] It can be said that adalah is marked for formality
 while ialah, being entirely absent form CJI, is very highly marked for
 formality.

The immigrants to Sri Lanka were mostly soldiers temporarily garrisoned in
Batavia/Jakarta and spoke a very colloquial variety of Malay, remote from any
formal standard (Adelaar 1991, Smith et al. 2004, Nordhoff
2009). It is unlikely
that Formal Indonesian (or the equivalent historical variety) has had a significant
impact on their speech. The sociolinguistic profile of Colloquial Jakarta Indonesian
is closer to what would have been appropriate for the immigrants, although
the relations between the colloquial varieties of the 17th century and the contemporary
varieties are not exactly straightforward (Grijns 1991, Adelaar & Prentice
1996). The copula adalah can be found in CJI although it is extremely rare. The
following is an example of the copula in informal speech.

(23) 	Yang pasti bakal ngebikin gua terpesona banget adalah cewek
	which certain will make me enchanted very copula girl
	dengan rambut panjang yang tergerai, terus anggun CJI
	with hair long which flowing then elegant
	‘What would certainly very much enchant me is an elegant girl with long
flowing hair.’ (Sneddon 2006:79)

This specificational use of the copula in (23) is similar to example (14), repeated
as (24) for convenience.

(24) [Itthu vakthu kithang=nang nya-aada] asàdhaathang ini JVP katha hathu problem
      dist time 1pl=dat past-exist copula prox JVP quot  indef problem
    ‘What we had at that time was the so-called JVP-problem.’(K051206nar10)

While the functional properties of the copulas in CJI and SLM are similar, they
are morphologically very dierent. The Indonesian form is composed of the existential
plus the imperative/emphatic clitic, but the Sri Lankan form is composed
of the verb ‘to come’ and the conjunctive participle prefix asà-. It cannot be excluded
that a construction involving a copula crossed the Bay of Bengal with the
immigrants, but given the formal register with which this construction occurs in
Indonesia, this is not very likely. An additional argument against a historical relatedness
of the SLM and CJI constructions is the use of dhaathang ‘come’ in SLM.
Dhaathang would have had to replace the existential ada without any particular
motivation. One reason for the replacement of the morphological composition of
the copula could be influence from the adstrates. This will be discussed in the
following section.

4.2 Copulas in Sinhala and Tamil

Colloquial Sinhala has no copula as such, but uses a predicative sux -yi on adjectives
ending with a vowel (25). Adjectives which end in a consonant (26), and
other word classes ending in any sound do not take this sux (27).

(25) mee amu miris hari særa-yi Colloquial Sinhala
     prox raw chillis really strong-yi
    ‘These green chillies are really strong.’ (Gair 2003:794)

(26) mee dawasw@l@ haal bohom@ ganaN(*-yi) Sinhala
     prox days rice very expensive(-yi)
    ‘These days (uncooked) rice is very expensive.’ (Gair 2003:795)

(27) mam@ govi-yek(*-yi) Sinhala
      1s farmer-indef(-yi)
    ‘I am a farmer.’ (Gair 1998:241)

In Literary Sinhala, a similar sux -mi is also used for nominal predications,
as in (28).

(28)   mama goviyekmi Literary Sinhala
      1s-nom farmer.nom.1sg
      ‘I am a farmer.’ (Gair 1998:242)

There is some discussion of whether mi in should indeed be analyzed as a copula,
or rather as an agreement sux (Gair 1998:242). Whatever the right analysis
of -mi and similar forms, it is clear that the variety of Sinhala the Malays were
exposed to did not feature this form. The most copula-like element they are likely
to have encountered is -yi, which does not suggest itself as possible model for the
Sri Lanka Malay copula. Its form as a sux is very dierent from the verbal form
employed by Sri Lanka Malay, and its use for adjectival predications is precisely
one where the use of the Sri Lanka Malay copula is not found.

In Tamil, the existential iru is sometimes analyzed as a copula. This verb is
used for predications of existence as in (29) but also for locational predications as
in (30).

(29) kumaar-ukku oru paiya	iru-kki-aar¯n¯ Tamil
    Kumar-dat one boy iru-pres-3sm
  ‘Kumar has one boy/There exists one boy to Kumar.’ (Lehmann 1989:188)



(30) intak1 kiraama-tt-ilrrmuu(iru-kki koovil
      this village-obl-loc three temple iru-pres-3sn
‘There are three temples in this village.’ (Lehmann 1989:173)

Uses for property word predications (31) and nominal predications (32) are
ungrammatical.

While in (31) and (32) the English translational equivalent has a copula, it
does not seem pertinent to grant the same status to the Tamil form. An analysis as
an existential can cover both the meanings given in (29) and (30), namely ‘A boy
exists (for Kumar)’ and ‘Temple exist in this village’, while excluding the readings
‘Education exists importance’ and ‘Kumar exists a lawyer’. This is precisely

1The dot ·
separates the grammatical word from the first part of a long consonant which is
the result of certain morphosyntactic environments. The words in isolation would be inta and
kiraama. One could also choose to write inta kkiraama to correctly represent pronunciation and
orthography, but Lehmann chooses to leave the first part of the long consonant as the coda of the
preceding syllable, although he separates it with a dot to indicate the special status.

what we find in (31) and (32). It is true that iru is sometimes found in nominal
predications as in (33), but in that case, the noun is adverbialized by aakalaay,
and the construction can actually be shown to have a locational reading as well
(cf. Lehmann 1989:174).

Whatever analysis one prefers for iru, this Tamil form seems to be closer related
to the Sri Lanka Malay form aada,2 which would be used for translations of

(29) and (30), given in (34) and (35).
(34)

‘There are three (Hindu) temples in this village.’

(35)
Kumaar=nang hatthu aanak klaaki aada SLM
Kumar=dat

‘Kumar has one boy.’
While iru and aada are quite similar, the parallels between iru and (asà)dhaathang(apa)
are less striking, and it seems unlikely that Sri Lanka Malay emulated the Tamil
form iru with (asà)dhaathang(apa).

Sinhala and Tamil both have conjunctive participles, too. The conjunctive
participle forms of the verb meaning ‘to come’ in Sinhala (ævillaa) and Tamil
(vantu) are not used in a copular sense in these languages; they can only be used
in the original reading of temporal anteriority.

To sum up, while the Malay ancestor language, Sinhala, and Tamil all have
structures which come at least close to a copula, none of these structures is similar
enough to the SLM structure as to suggest itself as the driving force behind the
development of the copula in Sri Lanka Malay. It thus seems likely that the copula
in Sri Lanka Malay is an independent development.

5
The
emergence
of
copulas


The most common etymological source for copulas is an existential (Munro 1977)
or a positional verb (Stassen 1997:94). Stassen illustrates this with data from
Kiowa gathered by Watkins, which are repeated here.3 In (38) we see the last
reflexes of the original positional/locational use of do:. This locational use has
given way to the general use of do: as a copula, which can be seen in (39). In
return, most of the original uses of do: for locational purposes are now expressed
by other morphemes, e.g. -cél in (40). Do: has thus nearly fully completed the
grammaticalization from locational verb to copula.

The other common source for copulas are pronouns. This can be seen in the
famous example from Chinese (Li & Thompson 1977).

(41) jì yù qí sh¯eng yòu yù qi sˇı, shì
huò yˇe Archaic
Chinese

‘Wishing him to live and whishing him to die, this is indecision.’ (Li & Thompson
1977:424)

The demonstrative shì in this construction type was reanalyzed as a copula shì
(Li & Thompson 1977:424).

(42) nèi-ge rén shì

‘That man is a student’ (Li & Thompson 1977:422)

Next to Chinese, this pattern is for instance found in Hebrew, Arabic and furthermore
in a number of North American and African languages (Stassen (1997:77–
91)).

With regard to Sri Lanka Malay, we can say that the existential aada is dierent
from asàdhaathangapa and does not seem to be very much grammaticalized
towards a copula. The deictics ini and itthu are not recruited for copular purposes
either. Changes from lexical meanings like ‘coming’ to more grammatical meanings
like ‘copula’ have been investigated under the umbrella of grammaticalization.
The verb ‘come’ is a frequent source of a number of grammatical functions,
so that an investigation of the directions of development of this verb might shed
light on what we find in Sri Lanka Malay. Stassen (1997:92) notes that a minor
class of sources for the grammaticalization of copulas includes motion verbs
like ‘go’ and ‘come’, but unfortunately he does not cite languages illustrating the
‘come’ case, so that it is not possible to compare the Sri Lanka Malay case to
other purported instances of this path.

6
Grammaticalization
paths
of
COME


In the languages of the world, verbs meaning ‘to come’ often undergo grammaticalization
and can be used for a variety of grammatical functions. In French, venir
de is used to express immediate past, but the venitive meaning is bleached: it is
possible to say Jean vient de partir, literally ‘John comes from leaving’, meaning
that John has just left (and not that he has just come back). Heine & Kuteva
(2002:68–78) list a number of grammaticalization targets for COME: consecutive,
continuous, hortative, venitive, ablative, near past, benefactive, change-of-state,

14


future, proximative, purpose. The copula is not found among them. The closest
example to a copular use of COME I am aware of is the use as an auxiliary in
passive constructions, as found in Italian. In Italian, the verb venire can be used to
form passives as in (43). Those passives always have a dynamic interpretation.4

(43) Era chiaro che i ragazzi veni-vano maltratta-t-i Italian

‘It was obvious [that] the children were being ill-treated.’ (Maiden &
Robustelli 2000:282)

As in the Sri Lanka Malay case, the verb meaning ‘to come’ has lost its original
venitive meaning. There is no motion towards the deictic center involved in
(43). In Italian as in Sri Lanka Malay, the verb meaning ‘to come’ is completely
bleached and serves a purely grammatical function, which would in both cases be
fulfilled in English by the copula ‘to be’. However, the similarities end here. In
Italian, venire is used as an auxiliary for diathesis, which is part of a larger construction
involving a past participle. Both the auxiliary and the participle agree
in number with the subject of the sentence. In the Sri Lanka Malay case, the
absence of other verbs in the sentence suggests that asàdhaathang is not an auxiliary.
There is no particple either, let alone agreement. Furthermore, the Sri Lanka
Malay copula typically surfaces in intransitive, non-verbal predications, while the
Italian passive construction with venire requires at least a bivalent verb. The Italian
construction has a dynamic reading, while in the Sri Lanka Malay cases, a
stative reading is the norm. For naming uses for instance, a dynamic reading is
completely excluded. This all suggests that the grammaticalization path of Sri
Lanka Malay dhaathang ‘come’ is not the comparable to Italian venire, nor to
any other of the cases discussed in Heine & Kuteva (2002). With the knowledge
we have today, it seems that this grammaticalization from COME to a copula is
unique to Sri Lanka Malay.

Possible
grammaticalization
paths


In the preceding sections, I have ruled out inheritance of the copula construction,
or emergence through language contact. I have also shown that the existing literature
on grammaticalization paths does not cover the phenomenon encountered in
Sri Lanka Malay. Given this paucity of literature to hook on to, some speculation
as to the possible development may be warranted. One possible path from COME

to the copula would lead over an intermediate resultative stage. This resultative
reading of come is found for instance in English constructions like (44).

(44)
A dream come true
In this case, the original motion meaning of to come has been lost. There is
no spatial motion involved. What remains is the change of state from A to A’,
which is also what we observe in motion events like John came home from work.
In (44), the state of the dream changes from unrealized to realized/true.5 While
in English, this resultative reading is restricted to a small set of words (*A man
come tall, *A T-shirt come grey), in other languages, it has a wider application. In
To’aba’ita, the verb mai ‘come’ has an ingressive/resultative meaning when used
with a property concept as in (45).

(45)
fanua-’e rodo na-mai To’aba’ita
place-it:pfv
be.dark perf-come
‘It has become dark.’ (Lichtenberk 1991:487)
Heine & Kuteva (2002:74) note that “[t]his grammaticalization appears to be
particularly common in pidgin and creole languages.” While it is not entirely clear
whether Sri Lanka Malay should be seen as a Creole (Smith & Paauw 2006) or
not (Ansaldo 2008, Nordhoff
2009) it is clear that the immigrants to Sri Lanka
spoke Vehicular Malay, a trade language for inter-ethnic communication which
has been likened to a pidgin (Adelaar & Prentice 1996). As such, it is interesting
to note that Fa d’Ambu Creole Portuguese (46), Guayanese Creole French (47),
and Seychelles Creole French (48) show the resultative reading of the copula as
well.6

(46) tyipa bi sxa dual eli kumu pasa Fad’Ambu

‘His stomach hurt; he had eaten to much.’ (Post 1992:159)


(47)

‘He has become sick.’ (Corne 1971:90)
5Note also that the string come is present in English become, and venir ‘come’ is found in
French devenir ‘become’ and several Romance cognates.

6Furthermore, this is also found in Ghanaian Pidgin English (Huber 1996) and Chinook Jargon
(Grant 1996:236).

(48) i n vin larpâter Seychelles
Creole
French

come surveyor
‘He became a surveyor.’ (Corne 1977:80)

The grammaticalization from ‘to come’ to a resultative marker is the first step
in a grammaticalization chain I want to propose. The second case involves the
change from resultative to stative. For this case, especially the Seychelles Creole
French example in (48) is interesting. It shows a great resemblance to one of the
main uses of the SLM copula, namely membership in a (professional class) as in

(11) or also in (49) below.
(49) Umma=pe baapa dhaathangapa hathu inspector of police. SLM
mother=poss
father copula
indef
inspector of police.
‘My mother’s father was an inspector of police.’ (N060113nar03)

The dierence between the Seychelles Creole French example in (48) and the
Sri Lanka Malay example in (49) is the change from resultative to stative. The
Seychellois sentence is necessarily resultative, while the SLM sentence is necessarily
stative. In the Sri Lanka Malay sentence, the information is not about
the grandfather having passed an exam, thereby becoming an inspector of police
(unlike the Seychellois surveyor). Rather, it is the first mentioning of the grandfather
in this text, indicating his profession as a stative predicate without forcing a
resultative interpretation.

However, it is logically necessary that the grandfather must have made the
step from prospective inspector of police to certified inspector of police at one
point in time since it is unlikely that he was born inspector. With many predicates
there is a reciprocal entailment between the stative reading and a prior ingressive
/resultative one. This is especially true for predicates of profession: If you
become a professor, you are then a professor; if you are a priest, you must have
become a priest before.7 The second step of the grammaticalization chain is then
the change from a resultative reading entailing stative to a pure stative reading.
This is likely to have been pioneered by predicates of profession, which are still
one of the most frequent predicates found with the copula in Sri Lanka Malay.
Only later would other predicates where a resultative meaning is impossible (e.g.
sex) have followed suit. The proposed development can then be summarized as
follows:

(50) come>resultative>resultative entailing stative>copula (professions)>copula
7A similar case of resultative entailing a subsequent stative reading is Latin cognovi in the
perfect, literally ‘I have learnt’, which very often means ‘I know now’ with a present reading.

Conclusion


Sri Lanka Malay has a copula, which is mainly used for naming and predications
of class membership, although some information structure use especially
with regard to topic and comment is also found. This copula is derived from
the conjunctive participle form of the verb dhaathang ‘come’. Neither the formal
properties of the copula, nor its functional uses show parallels to any of the
possible languages of origin, i.e. Indonesian varieties, Sinhala, or Tamil. This
suggests an independent development. This independent development, however,
is not of a type attested in the literature on grammaticalization and seems to be
a new grammaticalization path not found up to now. While further research is
needed, a promising hypothesis is the development through an intermediate stage
of a resultative marker, as found in other contact languages like Seychelles Creole
French. This marker would then lose its resultative reading for predicates of profession
and become a semantically void copula, which then spreads to other types
of intransitive predication.
