Isn't structuralism rather associated to the Geneva School in Europe and Bloomfield in America? (To mention the earliest)  The 'Boasian trilogy' seems to be an excellent way to summarize the main idea, without need to bring in the Structuralists. A reference to Boas would help place this in historical perspective (turn of the 20th century, ie earlier than the heyday of structuralism, I would think). You could either reference Boas (1902):  Boas, Franz. 1902. Tsimshian texts. (Bulletin of the Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology 27). Washington: Government Printing Office.  or provide a reference to Foley (1999), which is (as I understand) where the phrase 'Boasian trilogy' is first found.  Foley, William A. 1999.

I seem to remember that the idea of people meeting and 'brainstorming' about lexical data (for instance, 'free association' in a given semantic field) has also been suggested, with reports about how that went.

With how many participants is it manageable?  The argument about resources can be wielded in various ways. From the linguist's point of view, having everyone present makes verifications and discussion faster than visiting people one at a time. From the point of view of the entire group, it means that 30 people are giving of their time simultaneously, perhaps with some of them 'idling' (having a comment to make / lexical information to provide and not getting a chance to be heard)."

First sentence: language documentation consists of the Boasian trilogy.  Second sentence: the dictionary is based on a Swadesh list.  As I understand, the Boasian trilogy is a consistent whole: the texts feed into the grammar and dictionary. The dictionary is *not* solely the product of elicitation; much less is it based on a short, 'culture-independent' word list. Boas knew better and would not have adopted this list as a tool, I think.  The reasons why some linguists don't produce big, substantial, beautiful dictionaries is because (i) it takes a lot of time (ii) it's considered as low-level work by some linguists, in view of a hierarchy between The Theory on the one hand and the data on the other. Quote from an Oxford professor, c. 1995: 'In linguistics, the lexicographer is the equivalent of the guy stacking the shelves at Sainsbury's.'   At present (late 2010s), another obstacle is that researchers are encouraged to move from one language to another rapidly, rather than encouraged to go deeper and deeper in the study of one language. If a documentation project on one language is limited to 36 or 48 months, that's too short for a really good dictionary."
120	42	Kap0i88kE98k	122	1509	1556	What counts as good lexicography?	"General comment: what is it that makes a dictionary good and reliable?  How far can 'the idiosyncrasies of the data' be worked out through public discussion of items, and to what extent does it require real examples from texts?  Dictionary definitions, however carefully worded, tend to be less illuminating than examples from texts. At least, both complement each other. To what extent is 'Dictionary Day' a 'standalone' method? How does it link up with the elicitation of texts?"
